# sustainable_farming_semiarid
This project is a volunteer initiative that supports small farmers in Brazilâ€™s semi-arid region by providing an accessible mobile application for agricultural planning. The system integrates public climate and soil data (INMET, CPTEC/INPE, NASA) and applies algorithms for soil moisture estimation, water storage capacity and balance calculations.
